# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**AxonTask Project**
**Version 1.0 - Effective Date: January 1, 2025**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AxonTask ("the Project"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to Tyler Mailman ("Licensor" or "Project Owner").

---

## Purpose

This Agreement enables the Licensor to:
1. Maintain dual-licensing (Business Source License + Commercial License)
2. Change licenses in the future if needed
3. Defend the Project against IP claims
4. Include your contributions in both open-source and commercial offerings

**You retain ownership of your contributions**, but you grant the Licensor broad rights to use them.

---

## Agreement

By contributing to the Project (submitting a pull request, patch, code, documentation, or any other material), you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

- **"You"** (or **"Your"**): The copyright owner or legal entity authorized to submit the Contribution.
- **"Contribution"**: Any original work of authorship, including modifications or additions to existing work, that you submit to the Project.
- **"Submit"**: Any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project, including GitHub pull requests, issues, emails, or other communication.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

**You hereby assign to the Licensor** the entire right, title, and interest in and to the copyright in your Contribution.

This means:
- ✅ The Licensor owns the copyright to your Contribution
- ✅ The Licensor can sublicense your Contribution under any terms (open-source or commercial)
- ✅ The Licensor can include your Contribution in proprietary offerings
- ✅ You can still use your Contribution in your own projects

**However, you retain**:
- The right to use your own Contribution for any purpose
- Credit and attribution as the original author
- The ability to re-use similar code in other projects

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You grant to the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to:
- Make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and distribute your Contribution
- Sublicense these rights to third parties

This applies to any patent claims you have that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution or the combination of your Contribution with the Project.

### 4. Your Representations and Warranties

You represent that:

1. **Ownership**: You are the original author of the Contribution or have the right to submit it
2. **Legal Right**: You have the legal right to grant the licenses in this Agreement
3. **No Conflicts**: Your Contribution does not violate any third-party rights (copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret)
4. **Employer Consent**: If you are employed, your employer has waived all rights to your Contribution, or you have obtained permission
5. **Accuracy**: All information you provide is accurate and complete

You agree to **notify the Licensor immediately** if any of these representations become inaccurate.

### 5. Contribution Standard

You are **not required** to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide support.

You may provide your Contributions **"AS IS"**, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, unless required by applicable law.

### 6. Third-Party Code

If your Contribution includes code you did not author (e.g., third-party libraries), you must:
1. Identify the source and license of that code
2. Ensure it is compatible with the Project's licenses
3. Include proper attribution and license notices

### 7. Employer or Institution Agreement

If you are making Contributions as part of your employment or on behalf of an institution, your employer/institution must also agree to this CLA, or you must provide written proof that your employer/institution has waived rights to the Contribution.

**Corporate CLA**: If your company will be contributing, please have an authorized representative sign the Corporate CLA (separate document).

### 8. Disclosure

The Licensor may disclose your identity and the fact that you have signed this Agreement.

Your Git commit history, including your name and email, will be publicly visible in the Project repository.

### 9. Future Changes

This Agreement applies to all Contributions you submit to the Project, now and in the future, unless you notify the Licensor otherwise in writing.

If the Licensor updates this Agreement, you will be notified via GitHub. Continued contributions after notification constitute acceptance of the new terms.

### 10. Disclaimer

THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL YOU OR THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE CONTRIBUTION OR THE USE OF THE PROJECT.

### 11. Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective upon your first Contribution and continues indefinitely.

**Irrevocable**: Once you grant rights under this Agreement, they cannot be revoked. However, you may stop making future Contributions at any time.

If you violate the terms of this Agreement, the Licensor may terminate your ability to contribute to the Project.

### 12. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of [Your State/Country], without regard to conflict of law principles.

## How to Sign This CLA

### Individual Contributors

By submitting a Contribution, you automatically agree to this CLA. No separate signature is required, but we recommend:

1. **Read this Agreement carefully**
2. **Add your name to the contributors list** (optional): Create a PR adding yourself to `CONTRIBUTORS.md`
3. **Submit your Contribution** via pull request

Your first pull request will include a CLA bot that confirms your agreement.

### Corporate Contributors

If you are contributing on behalf of your employer, please:

1. **Download the Corporate CLA**: [CORPORATE_CLA.md](CORPORATE_CLA.md) (coming soon)
2. **Have an authorized signatory sign it**
3. **Email the signed CLA** to themailmaninbox@gmail.com

- Record your agreement
- Allow your PR to be merged once confirmed

**To confirm**, simply reply to the bot's comment with:
```
I have read the CLA and I hereby agree to its terms.
```

## Why Do We Need a CLA?

### Protects Everyone

- **Protects the Project**: Ensures we have clear rights to all code
- **Protects You**: Confirms you have the right to submit your code
- **Protects Users**: Ensures they can use the software without legal risk

### Enables Dual Licensing

The Project uses:
- **Business Source License (BSL)** for the open-source version
- **Commercial Licenses** for businesses that need proprietary use

The CLA allows us to offer both without legal complications.

### Allows Future License Changes

If we need to change licenses in the future (e.g., convert to Apache 2.0 after the Change Date), the CLA allows us to do so without tracking down every contributor for permission.

### Industry Standard

CLAs are used by major projects like Apache, Google, Microsoft, Linux Foundation, and many others. This is a well-established practice.

## Your Rights as a Contributor

Even after assigning copyright, you retain:

1. **Attribution**: You will be credited in the contributors list and commit history
2. **Re-use**: You can use your own code in other projects
3. **Recognition**: Your contributions will be acknowledged in release notes (for significant contributions)
4. **Input**: Major contributors may be invited to provide input on Project direction
