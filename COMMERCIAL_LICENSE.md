A Commercial License removes the BSL restrictions and grants you the right to:
- ✅ Offer AxonTask as a paid SaaS or managed service
- ✅ Embed AxonTask in your commercial products
- ✅ Use AxonTask internally in large organizations (>$1M revenue or >25 employees)
- ✅ Resell or white-label AxonTask
- ✅ Keep your modifications proprietary (no source disclosure requirement)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I try AxonTask before purchasing?

Yes! Use the **Business Source License** for evaluation, testing, and development. You only need a Commercial License when you go into production for a Prohibited Purpose.

### What if I exceed my Starter tier limits?

You can upgrade to Professional at any time. We'll prorate your existing subscription.

### Do I need a license for each deployment?

- **Starter**: 1 production deployment
- **Professional**: Up to 5 deployments
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited deployments

"Deployment" = a separate running instance of AxonTask. Development/staging don't count.

### What happens if I stop paying?

Your license terminates, but **perpetual rights** remain for versions licensed during your subscription. You can continue using those versions, but no updates or support.

### Can I switch from BSL to Commercial mid-project?

Yes! Contact us and we'll backdate the license to your production launch date.

### Do contributors need a Commercial License?

No. Contributors operate under the [CLA](CLA.md) and BSL. Only **deployers** of AxonTask for Prohibited Purposes need a Commercial License.

### What if AxonTask converts to Apache 2.0 on the Change Date?

On January 1, 2035, AxonTask v0.x - v3.x (all versions before Change Date) convert to **Apache 2.0** and become fully open source. Your Commercial License remains valid for versions released after the Change Date.

### Can I negotiate pricing?

Enterprise tier pricing is fully negotiable. Starter and Professional are fixed, but we offer discounts for:
- Annual prepayment (17% off)
- Startups (YC, Techstars, etc. - email for details)
- Non-profits (case-by-case)
